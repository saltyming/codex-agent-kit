# Git Workflow

Signing, model attribution, commit message format, PR body format and branch naming are the user's preferences in `$CODEX_HOME/rules/codex-agent-kit--git-prefs.md` (read it the first time a session needs it); the kit sets no default.

- A value still `unset` when needed is asked for and written into the file; only the values needed now. A missing file: ask for this action and say the file is not installed.
- When the repository's convention (a palette project's contributing document, `CONTRIBUTING`, a PR template, recent `git log`) differs from a prefs value, ask which to follow here and record it under "Repository overrides". The current-turn instruction outranks the file.
- Check `git branch -vv` for the base before opening a PR.
- Destructive git (§ 13): `checkout --`, `restore`, `reset --hard`, `revert`, `clean -f*`, `stash drop`, `branch -D`, `push --force*`, `rebase`, `cherry-pick`. Inspect with `git status` and `git stash list`, plus `git log --oneline` or `git reflog` for history-affecting commands; the proposed line carries the flags the prefs require. "Go ahead" to the proposed line is authorization; "just run it" to an earlier ambiguous phrase is not. When the command would destroy more than the user seems to intend, say what else is affected and wait. A destructive command never undoes session edits (§ 11).
